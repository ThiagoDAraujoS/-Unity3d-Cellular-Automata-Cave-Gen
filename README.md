# Unity3d Cellular Automata Cave Gennerator
### Description
This is a simple tool for unity3d, it builds 2d cave maps with a cellular automata agorithm.  
These maps can be used to build actual underground levels.  
The window allows some iterations with the final generated cave map buffer.  
Look for this project's pdf [manual](https://github.com/ThiagoDAraujoS/Unity3d-Cellular-Automata-Cave-Gen/blob/master/Cave%20Generator%20Manual.pdf), it better explains this tool's functionalities.
